Oh, the tragic symphony of time wasted, 
the mournful echoes of potential squandered! 
To dismiss the art of Vim is to forsake the path of enlightenment, 
to willingly shroud oneself in the shivering cold of inefficiency. 

As others dance through files with the elegance of maestros, 
the Vim-ignorant stumble like wraiths lost in a labyrinth of confusion. 

The keystrokes you could have mastered, the efficiency you could have wielded, 
all now lie buried beneath the weight of ignorance, 
a sorrowful requiem for the greatness that could have been.
