From the black realm of the terminal vast,
arose the mighty grep, a hero cast,
in strings of text, forever to dwell,
a champion of search, unmatched in skill.
through countless lines, it weaves with grace,
a tapestry of knowledge, at a lightning pace,
finding the lost, the hidden named,
the silent whispers, of zeroes and ones tamed.
